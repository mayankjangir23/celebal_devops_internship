Steps followed-
1. create a file using touch command:- touch myfile.txt
2. once the file is created use command ls -l myfile.txt to get detailed information about myfile.txt
3. you will get something like this
4. -rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 0 May 30 11:41 myfile.txt
here -rw-rw-r-- are the permissions
first ubuntu is owner of the file and second ubuntu is the group that owns the file

5. to change the permission use numerical values which are mapped like this:-
r = 4, w = 2, and x = 1
add them for combinations:- 
  7 = rwx
  6 = rw-
  5 = r-x
  4 = r--

6. When done again use command ls -l myfile.txt to check the output

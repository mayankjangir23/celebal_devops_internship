Waht is PV and PVC?
===================
PersistentVolume (PV)
=====================
A piece of storage in the cluster (like a disk or NFS).
Created by admins or dynamically by the system.
Lives independently of Pods, i.e., data persists even if pods die or restart.

PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)
===========================
A user request for storage (like RAM requests for CPU).
It binds to a suitable PV (based on size, access mode, etc.)

Analogy
========
PV → Storage room in your company building
PVC → You asking for a room to store your documents
When approved (bound), you get access to the room

PV and PVC Architecture
========================
[ Pod ] --> [ PersistentVolumeClaim ] --> [ PersistentVolume ] --> [ Physical Storage (Disk, NFS, etc.) ]
